    "In this session you will be practicing a number of things you've learned over the last two days and seeing how you can combine those seemingly distinct concepts to solve a problem. First let's discuss the problem we intend to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we need to calculate the value of $\\pi$ (it's readily available in several libraries, but let's assume for the purposes of this excercise that you need to calculate it anyway). The approach we'll use for this is called a [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). For those unfamiliar with the term, Monte Carlo methods are a way to approximate values using random numbers which have some particular statistical properties relevant to the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method consists of the following steps:\n",
    "- Consider a unit square (x = [0, 1], y = [0, 1]) containing a quarter of a unit circle ($r = 1$)\n",
    "- Randomly select a point within the square\n",
    "- Determine whether the selected point is within the circle\n",
    "- As you select more points, the ratio of the number of points within the circle to the total number of points will converge towards $\\pi / 4$, so \n",
